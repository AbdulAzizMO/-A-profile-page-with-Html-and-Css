       <p>Adrian Raines, a character in the Bloodbound series, is the<br>CEO of Raines Corporation and a vampire, as well as the<br>leader of Clan Raines. He is also one of your love interests.<br>He is first seen in Book 1, Chapter 1</p>

                 <h2>Background</h2>
                 <hr class='line-2'>
                 <p class="found">Adrian was found by Gaius Augustine, presumably dying,<br>whereby the latter saved his life by Turning him into a<br>vampire. He woke up in a cabin, bloody and bewildered by his surroundings and circumstances. After a brief<br>update from Gaius, he was forced to kill a nearby man to quench his bloodthirst; this, according to Adrian, is the<br>only time he had murdered a human. However, this is proven to be false in Chapter 9, when a book hints at<br>Adrian and Gaius going on a murderous rampage shortly after turning. Gaius groomed Adrian to take Banner<br>Westbrook's place when the latter refused to follow Gaius any longer.</p>
